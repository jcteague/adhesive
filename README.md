`adhesive` is a simple build tool that uses UglifyJS to concatenate your JavaScript and make you a nice source map.

I expect this to be most useful for simple, front-end focused projects, particularly those that are already working with a traditional list of `<script>` tags in `index.html`.  There are many more sophisticated versions of this out there (HTML5 Boilerplate's build tool comes to mind).  
		
However, `adhesive` has some advantages: 
- there is very little configuration, so it won't take you more than a few minutes to get it working 
- it outputs source maps so you can easily debug the minified version of your code (in case it causes side effects) 
- it's so simple that you can grab the repo and modify it to your heart's content â€“ without spending very long learning how it works.
